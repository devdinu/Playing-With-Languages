Trying out Programming Languages like scala, python, java.

Whatever things i felt interesting, (How it looks in other language i tried it out.)

Obviously java is just for completion, and most of the time till now i've felt other languages evolved better acquiring good things from everywhere. 

Still tyring to figure out, whats best in what.
